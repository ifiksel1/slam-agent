# SLAM Agent Solutions Log
# Auto-populated by the SLAM agent after resolving issues during Phases 5-6.
# Each entry records a problem, root cause, and fix so future sessions can check here first.
#
# Format:
#   - id: unique identifier (auto-increment)
#     date: YYYY-MM-DD
#     phase: which phase the issue occurred in
#     hardware: relevant hardware (platform, sensor, algorithm)
#     symptom: what the user reported
#     root_cause: why it happened
#     fix: what resolved it
#     files_changed: list of files modified to fix
#     tags: searchable keywords
#
# Example:
#   - id: 1
#     date: 2026-02-06
#     phase: 5
#     hardware: {platform: jetson_orin, lidar: ouster_os1_64, slam: fast_lio2}
#     symptom: "SLAM publishes odometry but drone flies in wrong direction"
#     root_cause: "LiDAR mounted 90° rotated, extrinsic yaw offset missing"
#     fix: "Added -1.5708 rad yaw to extrinsicRot in FAST-LIO config"
#     files_changed: [config/fast_lio2.yaml]
#     tags: [coordinate_frames, extrinsics, rotation, fast_lio2]
